Datasets : 
==========

1. The synthetic is generated from the 'gen_simple_network' this also automatically calls the z_transformation code to transform the data.
2. The lucas datasets - 'lucas' is the original dataset, 'lucas2' is the changed dataset with the causes on the left hand side and the effects on the right hand side. When you load any of the lucas datasets you will have to 'z-tranform' them with 'data = z_transformation(data).
3. To run the code, call 'mainRLVQ(data)'
4. The parameters are set in parameters.m
